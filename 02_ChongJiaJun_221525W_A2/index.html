            <h2>About Smoking</h2>
            <p>
                Smoking is a practice in which individuals inhale and exhale the smoke produced from burning tobacco or
                other substances. It is primarily associated with the consumption of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and
                various tobacco products. Smoking has a long history and has been prevalent in different cultures for
                centuries.
            </p>
            <p>
                The act of smoking usually involves lighting the tobacco or substance, allowing it to burn, and then
                inhaling the resulting smoke into the lungs. The smoke contains numerous harmful chemicals, including
                nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide, which can have detrimental effects on both the smoker's health and
                those exposed to secondhand smoke.
            </p>

            <p>
                Tobacco product use is started and established primarily during adolescence. Nearly 9 out of 10 adults
                who smoke cigarettes daily first try smoking by age 18, and 99% first try smoking by age 26.
            </p>

            <p>
                There is a steady decline in smoking prevalence in the Singapore population over the years, from 13.9%
                in
                2010 to 11.8% in 2017 and 10.1% in 2020.

                                The history of smoking is long and varied, covering many eras and cultures. Indigenous
                                peoples in the Americas were among of the earliest smokers ever recorded, turning to
                                tobacco for religious and therapeutic rituals. After European exploration, the habit of
                                smoking expanded throughout the world, and tobacco became a widely traded good. The
                                widespread production and marketing of cigarettes in the 20th century, especially during
                                and after World War II, contributed to an increase in smoking prevalence. However,
                                attitudes changed as health dangers emerged and anti-smoking campaigns gained traction.
                                As more people became aware of the negative impacts of smoking, laws were tightened,
                                smoking rates decreased, and people had a better grasp of the risks to their health and
                                the effects it had on society.

                                Cigarettes contain a multitude of harmful substances, with nicotine being the primary
                                addictive component. Nicotine is a highly addictive stimulant that affects the central
                                nervous system, leading to dependency and withdrawal symptoms. Additionally, cigarettes
                                emit tar, a mixture of toxic compounds that damages the lungs and contributes to
                                respiratory problems. Other harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke include carbon
                                monoxide, which reduces oxygen levels in the body, and various carcinogens that increase
                                the risk of cancer and other serious health conditions.

                                    Smoking is a leading cause of lung cancer, resulting from the inhalation of harmful
                                    chemicals present in cigarette smoke. The carcinogens and toxins in tobacco smoke
                                    damage the cells lining the lungs, causing genetic mutations and uncontrolled cell
                                    growth. Over time, this process can lead to the formation of tumors and the spread
                                    of cancerous cells. Lung cancer caused by smoking is a significant public health
                                    concern, accounting for a substantial portion of all lung cancer cases. Quitting
                                    smoking can significantly reduce the risk of developing lung cancer and other
                                    related health complications.

                                    progressive and debilitating lung condition. The inhalation of harmful chemicals in
                                    cigarette smoke triggers chronic inflammation and damage to the airways and air sacs
                                    in the lungs. This results in reduced airflow, persistent coughing, wheezing, and
                                    breathlessness. Over time, COPD worsens and significantly impairs lung function,
                                    making it challenging for individuals to breathe and engage in daily activities.

                            Smoking takes various forms, each involving the inhalation of tobacco or other substances.
                            Traditional cigarette smoking, the most common form, involves burning and inhaling tobacco
                            leaves. Shisha or waterpipe smoking involves tobacco heated by
                            charcoal, with smoke passing through water before inhalation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Cigar smoking entails larger amounts of tobacco, potentially increasing health
                            risks. Pipe smoking, using a bowl-shaped pipe, also exposes users to harmful compounds.
                            Smokeless tobacco products like chewing tobacco or snuff are placed in the mouth, delivering
                            nicotine without combustion.

                            alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or vaping devices vaporize
                            nicotine-containing liquids. While some alternatives may seem less harmful, most still

                            <h1>Chewing Gum:</h1>
                            <p>
                                One of the most useful method in Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) is to chew gum.
                                Common NRT options include nicotine patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, and nasal sprays.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Chewing gum can aid in quitting smoking by addressing both the physical and
                                psychological aspects of nicotine addiction. Chewing gum provides a
                                controlled dose of nicotine, helping to manage withdrawal symptoms and cravings, while
                                gradually reducing nicotine dependence over time. Chewing gum also helps simulate the
                                oral fixation associated with smoking, providing a sensory substitute that can ease the
                                psychological urge to smoke.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="grid-item">
                            <h1>Exercise:</h1>
                            <p>
                                Engaging in regular exercise can be a valuable aid in quitting smoking by offering both
                                physical and psychological benefits. Exercise helps reduce nicotine cravings and
                                withdrawal symptoms by releasing endorphins, which alleviate stress and improve mood. It
                                also helps manage weight gain often associated with quitting, boosts metabolism, and
                                supports overall lung health, counteracting some of the negative effects of smoking.
                                Furthermore, exercise provides a productive distraction from smoking triggers,
                                contributes to a healthier lifestyle, and enhances self-esteem, reinforcing the
                                motivation to quit and maintain a smoke-free life.

                            <h1>Behavioral Therapy:</h1>
                            <p>
                                Behavioral therapy is a valuable tool for quitting smoking, focusing on identifying and
                                changing the patterns and triggers associated with smoking behavior. By working with a
                                trained therapist/Counsellor, individuals develop strategies to cope with cravings, manage stress,
                                and modify habits that prompt smoking. Behavioral therapy also provides goal-setting
                                techniques, support, and accountability, helping smokers build new, healthier routines
                                and responses to triggers. This approach fosters self-awareness, equips individuals with
                                effective coping skills, and reinforces their commitment to quitting, ultimately
                                increasing the chances of successful, long-term cessation.
